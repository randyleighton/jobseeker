== Job Seeker
Randy Leighton

This is an application to use when looking for a job. It is designed to help you track the information about the jobs you are applying for and who you are talking to. This will eventually integrate angularjs and ruby rails.

This will utilize the following branching structure:
	Master - Production Code
		Develop - pre production all features merge into this.
		Features - these will branch off most current develop then merge into develop when done.
